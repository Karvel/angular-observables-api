# Angular Observables API

## Set up

This is a .NET Core 2.1 project designed to serve as the traditional API for [Angular Observable Examples App](https://github.com/Karvel/angular-observable-examples-app). It is a very rudimentary implementation, used only to achieve basic CRUD functionality. Instructions for installing and running this project can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1) and [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial).

## Database

This API uses the in-memory database, which is reset whenever the server is restarted.
